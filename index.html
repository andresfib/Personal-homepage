                                                As a researcher, he has published more than 15 peer-reviewed papers and participated in several international conferences sponsored by ACM and IEEE.
                                                Worked towards a PhD on educational technologies for Computer Science education. Conducted empirical research at University of Warwick (UK) and University of Joensuu. Modified and evaluated the software after students' input in a participatory setting. Continued supporting the online community of developers and users of Jeliot 3, now with developers at Kenya, Ireland, Germany, China, Israel and the USA. Created Jeliot 3 plug-ins and extensions for education and software development tools (e.g. Moodle, eclipse). Designed and operated technology workshops for children at the three editions of Joensuu’s SciFest using the open source tool Alice and Jeliot 3 together with researchers from Finland and Israel. Taught programming and technical writing to international Master's students at University of Joensuu. Drafted and coordinated several research proposals. 
                                                Implemented and documented the learning software Jeliot 3 as part of the Virtual University of Finland project. The work involved deconstructing a Java dynamic interpreter to automatically produce animated visualizations of students’ code. Integrated several software packages with different open source licenses in Jeliot 3 and released the new software as open source. Worked closely with international programming educators to shape the software. Wrote several academic papers and presented them and the software in international conferences. The software got to win the American Premier Award for educational resources
