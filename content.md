In my professional life I have combined research and development experience in educational software, visualizations and ICT for Development. In those fields I have integrated different approaches and tools to create innovative solutions. Currently I am part of the et.Lakes project that aims to create a successful start-up community in Easter Finland. I am part also part of the development team of Jeliot 3, a programming education tool that is used all around the world to teach Java.
